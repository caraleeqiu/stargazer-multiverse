### **《未名情诗》**

**【开场 | ~1 Minute】**

**(A line of elegant, handwritten text appears on the screen.)**

> **POV: In the case file of life, you are the one variable for whom I'm willing to break all the rules.**

**(Fade in.)**

**SCENE:** Late night. A VIP room in the Themis Central Hospital.
**YOU:** You are a junior attorney at the NXX Investigation Team, and also the childhood friend—the "little sister"—of the renowned attorney, Luke Pearce.

The scent of antiseptic fills the air. You slowly open your eyes, and the first thing you see is Luke's face, etched with exhaustion and worry. A faint stubble shadows his sharp jawline, and his usually immaculate shirt is wrinkled.

During a covert investigation into a smuggling ring, you were injured by a falling container while shielding him. You've been unconscious.

As you look into his bloodshot eyes, a strange, unfamiliar emotion grips your heart.

What is the first thing you say to him?

*   **CHOICE A:** **(Whispering, with a hint of teasing)** "Attorney Pearce... if you keep staring, I'm going to have to start billing you by the hour..."
*   **CHOICE B:** **(Weakly raising a hand, wanting to touch his face)** "Don't worry... I'm okay..."
*   **CHOICE C:** **(Looking around, confused)** "Luke... what happened? Why am I here?"

**【BRANCHING SCENES | ~2 Minutes】**

**(Your choice leads to one of three distinct intermediate scenes.)**

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE A (Teasing Route):**

> He blinks, and the tight line of his mouth softens for a fraction of a second. He leans closer, his voice hoarse and laced with an unprecedented severity. "Don't joke. This isn't a case we can debate." As he speaks, he clumsily tries to pour you a glass of water, the rim of the cup clinking against your lips. You see the panic in his eyes and realize his ironclad composure has finally cracked.

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE B (Comforting Route):**

> Before your fingertips can reach him, he captures your hand. His palm is scorching hot, trembling slightly. He presses your hand against his cheek, closing his eyes. "...Don't ever do that again," he murmurs, his voice barely audible. You can feel the terror suppressed beneath his skin. For the first time, you truly feel the turbulent ocean raging beneath his calm exterior.

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE C (Confused Route):**

> He immediately slips into "attorney mode," explaining the events with clear, logical precision. But his tightly clenched fists betray him. When he gets to the part where "you pushed me away," his voice cracks for a split second. He composes himself and starts peeling an apple for you with forced calmness. As he hands it to you, you notice a small, fresh cut on his fingertip.

**【CORE CHOICE | Determines the Ending | ~2 Minutes】**

**(All branches converge at this critical scene.)**

The room is quiet, filled only with the soft, rhythmic sound of him peeling the apple. You watch his focused, clumsy profile and realize that the invisible wall between you—the one labeled "childhood friends"—is now covered in fractures from this incident.

It is now up to you to decide whether to shatter it completely.

**【SECOND CHOICE】**

What do you say to him?

*   **CHOICE A:** **(A courageous confession)** "Luke, I don't want to be your 'little sister' anymore."
*   **CHOICE B:** **(A quiet thanks)** "Thank you, Luke. It must have been hard on you these past few days."
*   **CHOICE C:** **(A tentative question)** "We're... we're just partners and childhood friends, right?"

**【THREE DISTINCT ENDINGS】**

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE A (Confession - HE: Happy Ending):**

> The knife in his hand stills abruptly, nicking his finger. A single drop of blood wells up, but he doesn't seem to notice. He just looks at you, his eyes wide with disbelief. The silence stretches on, long enough to make your heart pound with regret.
> Finally, he puts everything down. He locks his gaze onto yours, his voice hoarse, yet trembling with a profound sense of relief.
> **"...I've been waiting eight years to hear you say that."**
> (Fade to black. End.)

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE B (Thanks - NE: Normal Ending):**

> He looks up and offers you a gentle, tired smile. "Don't be silly. It's my duty to take care of you."
> He hands you the peeled apple, and just like that, everything returns to the safe, warm, yet distant space you've always known.
> You know that he has quietly, meticulously, repaired the cracks in the wall between you. The city lights outside are as bright as ever, but a small light inside your heart has just gone out.
> (Fade to black. End.)

#### **---> IF YOU CHOSE C (Question - OE: Open Ending):**

> He stops peeling the apple and looks up, a complex light flickering behind his glasses. He doesn't answer your question directly. Instead, he poses one of his own.
> "...And what do you think we should be?"
> He tosses the question back to you, like a meticulously prepared case file. As the moonlight streams in, you see the faintest hint of a hopeful smile playing on his lips. Your story is not over yet.
> (Fade to black. End.)
