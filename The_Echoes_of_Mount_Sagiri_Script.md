### **《狭雾山上的残响》**

**【开场 | ~1 Minute】**

**(The screen is black, with a single line of white text.)**

> **"To all the children who never returned."**

**(Fade in.)**

**SCENE:** Late night, Mount Sagiri, inside Sakonji Urokodaki's hut.
**YOU:** You are Sakonji Urokodaki.

Outside, a thick fog blankets the mountain, like the silent sighs of the children you've lost. Tanjiro has left for the Final Selection on Mount Fujikasane, just as so many others did, years ago.

Your gaze falls upon the row of masterfully carved fox masks lining the wall. Each mask represents a soul you cherished.

A gust of wind blows through the hut. On the shelf, the masks of Sabito and Makomo seem to tremble slightly.

**【FIRST CHOICE | ~1.5 Minutes】**

Tonight, who do you remember?

*   **CHOICE A:** You remember **Sabito**. The boy who burned as brightly as a flame, yet fell as swiftly as a shooting star.
*   **CHOICE B:** You remember **Makomo**. The girl who was as gentle as a stream, yet whose waters never reached the sea.

---

**(IF CHOICE A IS SELECTED, THE STORY CONTINUES DOWN SABITO'S PATH.)**

**【SCENE: SABITO'S MEMORY | ~2 Minutes】**

**(Flashback: Daytime, many years ago. The training grounds on Mount Sagiri.)**

You remember Sabito's talent. Of all your students, he was the closest to mastering the art of the Water Hashira. But he was too eager. His blade was filled with a rage that was both his greatest strength and his fatal flaw.

The day before he was to split the great boulder, you decided to impart one final lesson.

**YOU:** "Sabito, your strength is undeniable. But a true swordsman must make a choice before he unsheathes his blade."

**【SECOND CHOICE】**

What do you choose to teach him?

*   **CHOICE A:** **"Channel your rage.** Let your hatred for demons become the force that cuts through everything. Your blade must be more ferocious than any demon."
*   **CHOICE B:** **"Empty your heart.** Forget your rage, forget your technique. Feel only the flow of the water. Your blade should end the fight before the enemy even senses your killing intent."

**(REGARDLESS OF THE CHOICE, THE STORY PROCEEDS TO THE ENDING. THE CHOSEN LESSON WILL ALTER THE FINAL REFLECTION.)**

**【ENDING | ~1.5 Minutes】**

**(Fade back to the present: Late night, inside the hut.)**

You are startled from your memories.

Sabito never returned.

**(If you chose A - Rage):**
> You think to yourself, perhaps it was I who made him focus too much on his rage. After exhausting himself by slaying countless demons, he lacked the final ounce of calm needed to face the grotesque Hand Demon.

**(If you chose B - Emptiness):**
> You think to yourself, perhaps it was I who pushed him too hard to achieve a state of 'emptiness.' In that final moment, the overwhelming hatred of the Hand Demon may have pierced his tranquility, creating a fatal opening.

You rise and walk to the boulder that Tanjiro split. Through the thick fog, you can almost see the figures of Sabito and Makomo. They are smiling, looking towards the direction Tanjiro left.

This time, a new sun is rising.

**(Fade to black. End.)**
